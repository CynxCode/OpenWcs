## What's that?
We're aiming to create a webcam software for linux users and embedded system enthusiasts which is easy to control and easy to setup.
Setting up a webcam on a Raspberry for example is a long and exhausting task. 
Programs and dependencies have to be installed, most programs are already abandoned and the few alternatives don't really have an easy interface and few functions.
